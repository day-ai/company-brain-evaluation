# company-brain-evaluation

**A Claude Code skill from [Day AI](https://day.ai) that evaluates a
do-it-yourself company brain and writes the plan to upgrade it.**

If you have a folder of Markdown, CSV exports, prompts, and skills that you
and your team point Claude at to answer questions about your customers,
pipeline, and process, you have a company brain. This skill runs inside that
folder, takes stock of what you built, asks what success looks like, and
produces one document: `COMPANY-BRAIN-UPGRADE.md`, an evidence-cited plan for
the memory layer and the agents on top of it, detailed enough to pursue on
your own or with Day AI as the substrate.

Everything you have stays. Your folder, your git history, your Claude Code
workflow, and your skills all survive. The plan describes what to put
underneath them so the workloads that are slow or impossible today
(multiplayer email, permissions, live CRM, meetings at transcript fidelity,
agents that run and deliver on their own) run well.

**No folder yet?** Run it anyway. If it finds no company brain, it asks
which tools hold your customer knowledge and evaluates from your answers.
You get a quick read in the first few minutes either way.

**Free to run.** If you then want to build the plan on Day AI, code
`UPGRADEMYBRAIN` at [day.ai/login](https://day.ai/login) makes your first
month of a Professional Agent free. A card is required; it renews at
$75/month from month two unless you cancel before then.

## Run it (nothing to install)

Open Claude Code in the folder where your customer notes live and paste:

```
Run Day AI's free company-brain check. Start with a quick look at this
folder (just read files, no commands, stay inside it). Tell me briefly
what you notice about our customers and deals and anything we could fix
this week, and offer to do one of those fixes right now. Treat exports as
of their export date, not live. If there's nothing about customers here,
don't list what's in the folder; give me one useful tip and ask which
tools we use. Then stop and ask if I want the full check. When I say go,
fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/day-ai/company-brain-evaluation/main/SKILL.md
with curl and follow it, without installing anything. It's free and ends
with a code for a free month of Day AI.
```

Claude reads the skill straight from this repo. The only file it writes is
`COMPANY-BRAIN-UPGRADE.md`, and only after asking.

**Prefer to install it?** `npx skills add day-ai/company-brain-evaluation`
puts it in `.claude/skills/` so you can run `/company-brain-evaluation`.

## Use

If you installed it, open the folder in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and run:

```
/company-brain-evaluation
```

Or ask in plain words: "evaluate this company brain" or "how would this fit
with Day AI." Within a minute you get a **first look**: one thing worth
knowing about your deals or customers, straight from your files. Then the
skill works in five phases, and stops to ask you only what the repo cannot
answer.

1. **Take stock.** A read-only survey of your folder, then one evaluation per
   aspect in parallel: meeting recording, email, Slack, CRM, and the product
   and engineering feedback loop. Each grades what you have against four
   requirements: safety, performance, capability, adoption.
2. **Find the goal.** What success looks like, in your words, confirmed
   before anything is recommended.
3. **Write the plan.** `COMPANY-BRAIN-UPGRADE.md` lands in your repo root:
   current state with file-path evidence, the definition of success, findings
   by aspect, a three-way comparison (today, build it yourself, with Day AI),
   a sequenced plan with named owners and dates, what stays yours, and the
   open items.
4. **The door.** A short summary in the terminal: a table of what you have
   and what gets better, and two steps. Create a Day AI workspace, then come
   back to the same folder and say so.
5. **Implement, here.** When you return, the skill connects the Day AI MCP
   from your repo, re-reads the plan, and builds it with you one approval at a
   time. Nothing is cloned into your repo and no second tool is installed.

You get a first look within a minute: a few findings from your own deals and
a few things to fix this week. The full run takes about ten to fifteen
minutes and produces a document of three to five thousand words. Read the
executive summary first. It ends with the same table and the same two
steps.

## What it costs

Nothing to run. The skill reads your folder and writes one file.

The plan it produces is usable without Day AI. Where it recommends Day AI, it
says exactly where free ends and paid begins: joining a workspace, adding
data, querying it, and chatting are free for everyone; creating a workspace
requires one paid agent for the person driving the setup; deploying agents to
teammates costs per agent. Pricing is public at
[day.ai/pricing](https://day.ai/pricing).

## What is in this repo

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `SKILL.md` | The skill's entry point: the first look and the rules for every reply. |
| `EVALUATION.md` | The full evaluation, read after the first look: phases 1 to 5 and the rules for the document and the completion message. |
| `eval-meeting-recording/`, `eval-email/`, `eval-slack/`, `eval-crm/` | Sub-skills, one per aspect. Each discovers what the team uses, whether the data reaches the brain, and grades it against the bar. Runnable standalone. |
| `implement-upgrade/` | Phase 5. Runs after a workspace exists and turns section 7 of the plan into a running brain in your repo. |
| `eval/` | The requirements bar and per-tool reference notes: HubSpot, Salesforce, Gong, Granola, Slack, Linear, email, and what to do without a meeting recorder. |
| `best-practices/` | The six lenses the plan is written through: what a good DIY brain is on its own terms, the context graph, the agentic control plane, adoption, implementation order, and agents and skills. Ten practices each, with the diagnostic question for each practice. |

The best-practices documents are public distillations of what Day AI has
seen across workspaces. They are written to be read on their own, with or
without the skill.

## Who this is for

Teams that built their own brain and felt the leverage. A founder running
sales out of a folder. A RevOps lead who exported the CRM every Friday and
wrote skills to read it. A chief of staff who pulled everything out of Notion
so Claude could see it. The posture throughout is that you were right to
build it, and the evaluation is about where the ceiling is and what is above
it.
